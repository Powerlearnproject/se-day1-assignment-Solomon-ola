Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software Engineering is a process whereby you apply both engineering principle, metthods and tools to develop system software.
The importance of software engineering in the tech space is that it enables the creation of software applications that solves mordern life problems like entertainment, healthcare, e-commerce sector.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: These includes  
(1) The establishment of software engineering as a dicipline in the 1960s.
(2) The development of programming language E.G {C}.
(3) The avert structure of programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answers:    
(1) Requirenments: This is the gathering and documenting user needs and system requirenments.
(2) Design: This is the creation of high level design for software user interface.
(3) Implemantation: This is the writing of codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
(4) Testing: When you test to make sure the software meets the required quality and functional satndard.
(5) Deployment: This is when the software goes live to customers or users.
(6) Maintenance: Providing of support, updates after the software has been deployed to live.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer: In this aspect, Waterfall goes according to the SEDL while the agile also follows the same techniques but in the event of change I.e the client change his/her mind and decided to make a fwe cahnges in the software the canges would be implemented quickly whly in the waterfall aspect it wou be done once the first update is deployed to test.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answers:    
(1) Software Dev: This is the person who writes and implement the software system
(2) Quality Assurance Engineer: This is the person who ensure the quality and testing of the software system.
(3) Project Manager: the PM is incharge of the planning and delivering of the software syetem.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer: The IDEs are used for writing codes why the VCS arre used to monitor the changes made in the codes and also orking with the teams. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio, pyCharm, etc, while VCS are Github etc.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Answers: Tight deadlines -> Add a minimum of 3days extra incase of any changes made by the clients.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Answers: 
(1) unit: This is when the component of a softare system is tested seperately
(2) integration: This is the process when 2 or more elements or components of a software system interact together 
(3) system: This is when you test the entire software sysetm as a whole
(4) acceptance: When you test against user requirenmentsto make sure it meed up with the needs of the user

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answers: Prompt Engineering is about crafting the correct questions or instruction to get the best responds from an artificial intelligent, it also helps us avoid asking vaude questions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer: 
Vague Prompt: Tell me about renewable energy.
Improved Prompt: Write in 500-words discussing the pros and cons of solar and wind energy as renewable energy sources.
The reason why the improved prompt is mor efficient is because it was specific on the scope and lenght which was wind and solar energy and aldo the defined lenght rather than just the vauge renewable.
